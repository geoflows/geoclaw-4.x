Module containg the classic Clawpack solvers

This module contains the pure and wrapped classic clawpack solvers.  All 
clawpack solvers inherit from the :class:`ClawSolver` superclass which in turn 
inherits from the :class:`~pyclaw.evolve.solver.Solver` superclass.  As such, 
the only solver classes that should be directly used should be the 
dimensionally dependent ones such as :class:`ClawSolver1D`.
